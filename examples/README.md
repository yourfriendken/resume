# Using This Repository

This example demonstrates how to use the resume repository structure effectively.

## Quick Start Example

This directory contains a sample resume (`sample-resume.md`) that demonstrates how to use the data structure and templates provided in this repository.

## How This Example Was Created

1. **Data Preparation**: Information was organized using the YAML structure from `/data/` files
2. **Template Selection**: Used the modern resume template from `/templates/markdown/`
3. **Customization**: Adapted the template with real-world examples
4. **Review**: Applied best practices from `/docs/` guidelines

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Professional formatting** with clear sections and hierarchy
- **Quantified achievements** with specific metrics and impact
- **Structured data organization** that can be reused across formats
- **Modern presentation** suitable for tech industry applications
- **ATS-friendly formatting** with standard headings and clear text

## Try It Yourself

1. Update the YAML files in `/data/` with your information
2. Choose a template from `/templates/`
3. Replace the placeholder variables with your data
4. Customize styling and sections as needed
5. Generate your final resume format

## Template Variables Used

This example shows how template variables like `{NAME}`, `{TITLE}`, `{EMAIL}` etc. can be replaced with actual data from your YAML files to create a complete resume.

For automation, you could create scripts that:
- Read data from YAML files
- Replace template variables
- Generate multiple formats (PDF, HTML, etc.)
- Maintain consistency across all versions

## Next Steps

- Customize the data files with your information
- Experiment with different templates
- Create your own template variations
- Set up automated generation if desired
